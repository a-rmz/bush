# bush — bearly usable shell 🐻💻

Soon to be a barely (yes, yes, it's a pun) usable terminal emulator, implemented for our Operating Systems Fundamentals course, but who knows how far can we make it with this…

## Developing
The `venv` provides a pseudo-virtual environment, making it easier to execute the compiled commands. What it does is add the `build` directory to the `PATH`, so you can call the commands as only `init`, `getty` or `sh`.

### Running
* Execute `source venv`
* Develop normaly
* When done, execute `deactivate` so the `PATH` is returned to normal

### Questions?
